题目描述:
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
For example,
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"is a palindrome.
"race a car"is not a palindrome.
Note:
Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.
For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

题目解析:
比较简单，去除掉其余不相干的字符串，然后查看是否为回文串。
